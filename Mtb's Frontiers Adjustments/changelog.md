## Version 0.7.0

IMPORTANT: Some of the more controversial changes are now in the code file. This is done on purpose to allow any users who don't want these changes to easily turn them off without me having to maintain several versions of the mod.

Code File:
-Infinite Boost + Hide Boost Meter. (Mod will be balanced around this but this way you can easily remove the two codes from this file and play with the finite boost)
-Disable Power Boost (For Prelimenary  Combat Update support. Tends to make the speed upgrade worthless)
-Infinite Quick Cyloop Gauge (Flows better. may be removed if too op)

Open Zone:
-Decreased Homing Attack Delay to match cyberspace
-Reverted Infinite Boost changes to instead use a code file
-Adjusted Max GravityAccel/Decel so that Sonic feels a little more weighty
-Made Drop Dash Controllable
-Set parry time to 0.8 (To be re-evaluated when combat is focused on.)
-Increased Bounce Jump Height (Doesn't work on all surfaces. Not sure how to fix this)

## Version 0.6.0
I'm looking into making a toggle for just Cyberspace physics. Expect that soon.

Open Zone Updates:
- Forces Style Airboost
- Removed Boost Drain

3D Cyberspace Updates:
- Very minor increase of homing attack delay
- Very Minor Skateboard Turn Tweak (More Responsive at first)
- Slight Bounce Height Increase
- Light speed dash speed increase
- Jumping adjustments (Loses less speed when holding forward and loses far more speed when holding back)
- Slight increase in vertical speed with the airboost
- Match airboost speed with regular boost
- Drop Dash Adjusted (speed increase to match the speed of the boost, turning improved)


2D Cyberspace Updates:
- Sync homing attack delay with 3D
- Re-adjusted Light speed dash to brake again. (The reach was too far otherwise) (may be reverted if people don't like this)
- Increased boost speed slightly
- Match airboost speed with regular boost
- Faster Wall Jump

## Version 0.5.1

- HOTFIX: reverted fall speed changes since it broke compatibility with 4-1
