## Version 0.6.0
I'm looking into making a toggle for just Cyberspace physics. Expect that soon.

Open Zone Updates:
- Forces Style Airboost
- Removed Boost Drain

3D Cyberspace Updates:
- Very minor increase of homing attack delay
- Very Minor Skateboard Turn Tweak (More Responsive at first)
- Slight Bounce Height Increase
- Light speed dash speed increase
- Jumping adjustments (Loses less speed when holding forward and loses far more speed when holding back)
- Slight increase in vertical speed with the airboost
- Match airboost speed with regular boost
- Drop Dash Adjusted (speed increase to match the speed of the boost, turning improved)


2D Cyberspace Updates:
- Sync homing attack delay with 3D
- Re-adjusted Light speed dash to brake again. (The reach was too far otherwise) (may be reverted if people don't like this)
- Increased boost speed slightly
- Match airboost speed with regular boost
- Faster Wall Jump



## Version 0.5.1

- HOTFIX: reverted fall speed changes since it broke compatibility with 4-1
